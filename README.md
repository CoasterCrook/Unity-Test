# Unity Test
This is a Unity Game developed with C#. Code written as part of an Instructor Guided Course on Udemy.

This is my first repository!

The objective of the game is to drive around a scene and deliver packages which are pink to the orange squares. There are collisions, power ups, and some cool sprites that were from the Udemy Course.
